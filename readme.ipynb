    "- Even though almost an equal number of bikes are rented during mornings and afternoons, when this data is narrowed down to only the ten most popular stations, it is found that the number of rentals during the mornings are far more than the number of rentals during the afternoons. This indicate that in other stations, most bikes are rented during afternoons.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a steep decline in the duration of travel for customers from April to May. This can be probably accounted to the fact that it summer and people cannot ride a bike for so long. Interestingly, there is an increase in the average duration from April to May for Subscribers. This makes logical sense since Subscribers as previously seen are huge in number and rent a bike only for shorter durations hence shorter distances. Hence, the impact of weather on such distances can be neglected and hence, the increase.   \n"
